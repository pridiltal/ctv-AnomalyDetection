    This CRAN task view contains a list of packages that can be used for anomaly detection. Anomaly detection problems have many different facets and the detection techniques can be highly influenced by the way we define anomalies, the type of input data to the algorithm, the expected output, etc. This leads to wide variations in problem formulations, which need to be addressed through different analytical approaches.
   </p>
   <p>
     Anomalies are often mentioned  under several alternative names such as outliers, novelty, odd values, extreme values, faults, aberration in different application domains. These variants are also considered for this task view.
   </p>
   <p>
     <strong>The development of this task view is fairly new and  still in its early stages and therefore subject to changes. Please send suggestions for additions and extensions for this task view to the task view maintainer. </strong>

   <strong>Univariate Outlier Detection</strong>
   </p>

     </li> 
     <li> The <pkg>hotspots</pkg> package supports univariate outlier detection by identifying values that are disproportionately high based on both the deviance of any given value from a statistical distribution and its similarity to other values.
     </li>
     <li> The <pkg>outliers</pkg> package provides a collection of tests commonly used for identifying <i>outliers</i>. For most functions the input is a numeric vector. If argument is a data frame, then outlier is calculated for each column by sapply. The same behavior is applied by apply when the matrix is given.
     </li>
     <li> The <pkg>extremevalues</pkg> package offers outlier detection and plot functions for univariate data. In this work a value in the data is an outlier when it is unlikely to be drawn from the estimated distribution.

   <p> 
   <strong>Multivariate Outlier Detection</strong>
   </p>
   <ul>
     <li> Under <i>multivariate, high-dimensional or multidimensional scenario,</i> where the focus is on n (>2) - dimensional space,  all attributes might be of same type or might be a mixture of different types such as categorical or numerical, which has a direct impact on the implementation and scope of the algorithm. The problems of anomaly detection in high-dimensional data are threefold, involving detection of: (a) global anomalies, (b) local anomalies and (c) micro clusters or clusters of anomalies.  Global anomalies are very different from the dense area with respect to their attributes. In contrast, a local anomaly is only an anomaly when it is distinct from, and compared with, its local neighbourhood.  Micro clusters or clusters of anomalies may cause masking problems. 
     </li>

     </li>
     <li> The <pkg>solitude</pkg> package provides an implementation of Isolation forest which detects anomalies in cross-sectional tabular data purely based on the concept of isolation without employing any distance or density measures.
